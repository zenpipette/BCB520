The awards we will consider are:\n\n## Hart Memorial Trophy\nAwarded to the \"player judged most valuable to his team.\" This isn't necessarily the best overall player, but rather the one who contributes most significantly to his team's success.\n\n## Vezina Trophy\nPresented to the goaltender \"adjudged to be the best at this position.\" NHL general managers vote on this award.\n\n## James Norris Memorial Trophy\nAwarded to the defenseman who demonstrates \"the greatest all-around ability\" at the position.\n\n## Calder Memorial Trophy\nGiven to the player \"adjudged to be the most proficient in his first year of competition.\" This is essentially the rookie of the year award.\n\n## Frank J. Selke Trophy\nAwarded to the forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game.\n\n## Lady Byng Memorial Trophy\nPresented to the player who exhibits \"the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\"\n\nNote that I've eliminated the awards that are determined by raw counting statistics (most goals, most points).  The awards above are all based on votes from NHL media and executives, and the criteria are at least somewhat subjective.\n\n\n\n### Here is the goal:\n\nFor each award, create your ballot of five players, ranked from 1 (your first choice) to 5 (your fifth choice).  For each ballot, provide one to three visualizations that explain and justify your ballot.\n\n\n## THE DATA\n\nAt minimum, we will use the data from naturalstattrick.com for player statistics for the season to date (Oct 2024 to March 2025).
