# OVERVIEW

In this assignment, we are going to practice creating visualizations for tabular data. 

# SCENARIO

We are going to use NHL data on the season to date to create data driven ballots for several key awards.  The awards we will consider are:

## Hart Memorial Trophy
Awarded to the "player judged most valuable to his team." This isn't necessarily the best overall player, but rather the one who contributes most significantly to his team's success.

## Vezina Trophy
Presented to the goaltender "adjudged to be the best at this position." NHL general managers vote on this award.

## James Norris Memorial Trophy
Awarded to the defenseman who demonstrates "the greatest all-around ability" at the position.

## Calder Memorial Trophy
Given to the player "adjudged to be the most proficient in his first year of competition." This is essentially the rookie of the year award.

## Frank J. Selke Trophy
Awarded to the forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game.

## Lady Byng Memorial Trophy
Presented to the player who exhibits "the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability."

Note that I've eliminated the awards that are determined by raw counting statistics (most goals, most points).  The awards above are all based on votes from NHL media and executives, and the criteria are at least somewhat subjective.



### Here is the goal:

For each award, create your ballot of five players, ranked from 1 (your first choice) to 5 (your fifth choice).  For each ballot, provide one to three visualizations that explain and justify your ballot.


## THE DATA

At minimum, we will use the data from naturalstattrick.com for player statistics for the season to date (Oct 2024 to March 2025).  You can find the Data Dictionary [here](DataDictionary.qmd)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
Individual.Skater <- read.csv("SkaterIndividualstats.csv")
OnIce.Skater <- read.csv("SkaterOnicestats.csv")
Goalie <- read.csv("Goalies.csv")
Individual.Skater.Rookie <- read.csv("RookieSkaterindividual.csv")
OnIce.Skater.Rookie <- read.csv("RookieSkaterOnIce.csv")
Rookie.Goalie <- read.csv("RookieGoalies.csv")
```

```{r, eval=F}
view(Individual.Skater)
view(OnIce.Skater)
```


## Counting Stats for Skaters

```{r}

ggplot(Individual.Skater, aes(x=Total.Points))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Total Points",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Total Points",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(Individual.Skater, aes(x=Goals))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Goals Scored",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Goals Scored",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(Individual.Skater, aes(x=Total.Assists))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Total Assists",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Total Assists",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```
## On Ice Stats for Skaters

```{r}

ggplot(OnIce.Skater, aes(x=CF.))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Corsi Percentage",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Corsi Percentage",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(OnIce.Skater, aes(x=as.numeric(GF.)))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Goals For Percentage",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Goals For Percentage",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(OnIce.Skater, aes(x=as.numeric(xGF.)))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Expected Goals For Percentage",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Expected Goals For Percentage",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```

## Stats for Goalies

```{r}

ggplot(Goalie, aes(x=SV.))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01)+
  labs(x = "Save Percentage",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Save Percentage",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(Goalie, aes(x=GAA))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .2)+
  labs(x = "Goals Against Average",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Goals Against Average",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

ggplot(Goalie, aes(x=GSAA))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Goals Saved Above Average",
       y = "Number of Players",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title = "Distribution of Goals Saved Above Average",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```

# Vezina Trophy
Presented to the goaltender "adjudged to be the best at this position." NHL general managers vote on this award.


```{r goalie_m1}
goalie_m1 <- lm(Saves~GP, data=Goalie)
```

The red line on the graph shows where an approximate cut-off point could be. We want the players above the line. 

```{r Saves made per games played}
ggplot(data=Goalie, aes(x=GP, y=Saves))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_abline(aes(intercept=goalie_m1$coefficients["(Intercept)"],
                  slope=goalie_m1$coefficients["GP"]))+
  geom_hline(yintercept=1100, color="red")+
  labs(x="Games Played",
       y="Saves made by the goalie",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title="Saves Made per Games Played",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```

```{r goalie_m2}
goalie_m2 <- lm(Saves~Shots.Against, data=Goalie)
```

The red line on the graph shows where an approximate cut-off point could be. We want the players above the line.

```{r Saves made per shots against}
ggplot(data=Goalie, aes(x=Shots.Against, y=Saves))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_abline(aes(intercept=goalie_m2$coefficients["(Intercept)"],
                  slope=goalie_m2$coefficients["Shots.Against"]))+
  geom_hline(yintercept=1100, color="red")+
  labs(x="Shots Against",
       y="Saves made by the goalie",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title="Saves Made per shots against",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```
```{r goalie_m3}
goalie_m3 <- lm(SV.~GP, data=Goalie)
goalie_m3$coefficients["(Intercept)"]
goalie_m3$coefficients["GP"]
```

```{r}
plot(goalie_m3)
```



```{r percent Save per Games Played}
ggplot(data=Goalie, aes(x=GP, y=SV.))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_abline(aes(intercept=goalie_m3$coefficients["(Intercept)"],
                  slope=goalie_m3$coefficients["GP"]))+
  #geom_hline(yintercept=1100, color="red")+
  labs(x="Games Played",
       y="% Shots against that were saves",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title="% Saves Made per Games Played",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```

I want to see who are the top 5 in GP, Saves, and SV.
Top 5 in GP:
```{r top 5 in GP}
Goalie |> select(Player, GP, Shots.Against, Saves, SV.) |>
  arrange(desc(GP)) |>
  slice_head(n=5)
```
Top 5 in Saves:
```{r top 5 in Saves}
Goalie |> select(Player, GP, Shots.Against, Saves, SV.) |>
  arrange(desc(Saves)) |>
  slice_head(n=5)
```
Top 5 in Sv.:
```{r top 5 in SV}
Goalie |> select(Player, GP, Shots.Against, Saves, SV.) |>
  arrange(desc(SV.)) |>
  slice_head(n=5)
```

## Vezina ballot

Once the data is filtered by > 40 games played and > 1100 saves, it seems like the best discerning feature would be % Saves (if I understand the data correctly). Once those are all sorted out, the top 5 players below will be on my Vezina Trophy ballot.

The vezina ballot:

```{r final vezina ballot}
Vezina_ballot <- Goalie |> select(Player, GP, Shots.Against, Saves, SV.) |>
  filter(GP > 40) |>
  filter(Saves > 1100) |>
  arrange(desc(SV.)) |>
  mutate(Rank=row_number()) |>
  slice_head(n=5)
  
Vezina_ballot
```

# Hart Memorial Trophy

Awarded to the "player judged most valuable to his team." This isn't necessarily the best overall player, but rather the one who contributes most significantly to his team's success.

It seems like lots of games played plus lots of goals made would be a nice place to start. People towards the top right of the graph below should be taken into consideration for significant contribution.

```{r}
ggplot(Individual.Skater, aes(x=GP, y=Goals))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Games Played",
       y="Goals made",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       title="Goals versus Games Played",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")


```

That being said, not just the folks making the goals should be considered. Defense should be considered. One way to assess this might be with the OnIce.Skater data, using the GF statistics (count of goals for that player's team while that player is on the ice).

I'm sorting the top 20 so it can be visualized.

```{r}
hartmemorial <- OnIce.Skater |> select(Player, GF, GP) |>
  arrange(desc(GF)) |>
  slice_head(n=20)

hartmemorial
```


```{r}
ggplot(hartmemorial, aes(x=GF, y=reorder(Player, GF)))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme_bw()
```
Now I want to see a scatter plot with names in it.

When looking at this graph, the best contendors will be located in the top right.

```{r}
ggplot(hartmemorial, aes(x=GP, y=GF))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=Player), hjust=0.5, vjust=-0.5, size=2)+
  labs(title = "20 Contenders for the Hart Memorial Award",
       x="Number of games played",
       y="Count of goals while player is on ice",
       caption = "source: https://www.naturalstattrick.com/",
       subtitle = "2024-2025 season stats as of March 4")

```

## Hart Memorial ballot

After consideration, it seems to me that there is not an appreciable difference between playing 54 and 62 games, so that will not be considered. The only factor I will consider needed is GF, because this already sorts out players who have only played a small number of games. Therefore I will take the top 5 in the GF category:

The hart memorial ballot:

```{r final Hart Memorial ballot}
hartmemorial_ballot <- OnIce.Skater |> select(Player, GF, GP) |>
  arrange(desc(GF)) |>
  slice_head(n=5) |>
  mutate(Rank=row_number())

hartmemorial_ballot
```

# James Norris Memorial Trophy

Awarded to the defenseman who demonstrates "the greatest all-around ability" at the position.
